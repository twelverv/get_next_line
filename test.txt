Yes, there is no doubt in this world
we're always free
And there is nothing better than
an "I Love You" makes you gush with glee
Just wrap it with ribbons and make a smile,
it's nothing, ah hah
Your words are the treat that
I am waiting for,"lovely" ah, hah
Deep down from my heart
here is my present, oh
Sincerely from me here is my present, oh
Just take it from me.
There is nothing more
The love that I got, it's an open door
Don't even ask what the present's about
The present's about surprising your heart
Even if the date becomes a nightmare
Whatever mood you're in,
I got the best in the world present
Yes, there is a thing that
we find ourselves being clean
No matter what you've gotta say
an "I Love It" but it's how it is
All kinds of ribbons will make it look,
so pretty ah, hah
Gonna make you hype like getting it
for the first time
so hyper, ah, hah
Easiest feelings are hard to express
So, l'm giving you my true love
in wrappings, dear
Love's unconditional
I've found those words are true
And you're the one that
made me realize this love
Don't even ask what the present's about
The present's about surprising your heart
Even if every day seems like okay
The things that you don't realize is
what it's about
You and me together
is the most brilliant present
Deep down from my heart,
here is my present, oh
Sincerely from me, here is my present, oh
